# Hello Hackers


##  Intro to commands

### Challenge


In this challenge, you will invoke your first command! When you type a command and hit enter, the command will be invoked, as so:
```bash
hacker@dojo:~$ whoami
hacker
hacker@dojo:~$
```

Here, the user executed the whoami command, which simply prints the username (hacker) to the terminal. When the command terminates, the shell once again displays the prompt, ready for the next command.

In this level, invoke the hello command to get the flag! Keep in mind: commands in Linux are case sensitive: hello is different from HELLO.


### Solving

Over here in this challenge we are asked to implement the ``hello`` command so we can just enter ``hello``





### Flag
